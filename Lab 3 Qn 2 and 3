/*Qn2. The "if" statement is called a single selection statement. It selects or ignores a single action that is being processed. 
            The If statement either either performs an action if a condintion is true or skips the action if the condition is false.
            Where as the "while" statement is a repetion statement. The while statement allows you to specify that an app should repeat an action
            while some condition remains true.
            The similarity is that while statement is like a repeating if statement
